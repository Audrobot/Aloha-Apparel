# Aloha Apparel Co. Homepage

Utilizing HTML5, CSS and Flexbox, I have created a mobile-first, responsive layout, optimized for 350px, 600px, and 1240px screen sizes.

The following interactivity included in the layout was added with JQuery/Javascript: Flickity carousel displaying product, smooth scrolling navigation bar featured in header, and email subscription button detecting valid emails with prompts.
